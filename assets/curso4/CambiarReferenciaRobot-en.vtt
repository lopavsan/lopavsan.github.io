00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.240
In this video, we will see how to modify the

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.919
reference of the robot

3
00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.639
selected. We will take robot number

4
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.840
two, which has a specified working radius,

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.559
and we will look for a reference

6
00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.400
for a robot with a larger working radius.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.359
The first step is to select the

8
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.080
robot we want to change. We go

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.240
to the upper section and, in the

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.840
robot selector, choose number

11
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.960
two. As confirmation, we will see that its

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.880
working radius, or its working area

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.840
to be more precise, is highlighted in blue.

14
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.879
Now we go to the settings panel. 

15
00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.120
We make sure that 

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.920
robot number two is indeed the one 

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.079
we want to modify and click on 

18
00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.000
its current reference.

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.960
In the panel that opens, 

20
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.920
we will see a list of all possible 

21
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.559
references compatible with the 

22
00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.760
Multirobot application development 

23
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.480
platform.

24
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.239
There are a number of 

25
00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.359
filters, one of which indicates the 

26
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.159
working radius. We will choose a 

27
00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.560
radius of 800mm. 

28
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.520
We see that automatically the 

29
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.280
references that do not meet 

30
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.799
these filters are deactivated, and only 

31
00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.439
four of them are activated. 

32
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.400
We will choose the one that best fits 

33
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.520
our needs, for example, this one, 

34
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.119
which will be automatically highlighted in 

35
00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.360
yellow. This is our selection, but 

36
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.119
we haven't actually made the change yet. 

37
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.759
The robot currently active, robot 

38
00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.040
number two, still appears here, 

39
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.000
highlighted with a slightly

40
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.200
thicker line, and the desired one is highlighted with 

41
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.560
a yellow background. For this 

42
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.079
change to be valid, we need to restart 

43
00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.280
the controller. We click here on 

44
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.520
"Restart" and, after a few brief moments 

45
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.840
during which the display will be 

46
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.880
deactivated, the system will automatically 

47
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.799
restart. We exit online mode, 

48
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.840
re-enter to 

49
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.119
reactivate the visualizations, 

50
00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.479
we go to robot number two and see 

51
00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.119
that indeed the model has been 

52
00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.720
modified. To confirm this, we go 

53
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.280
to the automatic mode 

54
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.840
panel and we see that the working 

55
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.200
radius is much greater than it was 

56
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200
before.
