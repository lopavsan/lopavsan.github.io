00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.080
In this video, will be described the

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.160
composition of the visualization 

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.839
screens used by the

4
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.160
application. To access them, we will

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.679
double-click on "Vis_Principal" or, if we are not

6
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.360
using the development

7
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.400
environment, we will use a web browser

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.400
and the address http, IP of the controller,

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.320
port 8080 and the page name

10
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.840
"webvisu.htm". Well, a visualization

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.160
screen is composed of four

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.760
sectors: a top sector where

13
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.720
you can choose the robot 

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.760
you want

15
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.840
to interact with. Then, there is also a

16
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
set of buttons to request

17
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.360
entry into one working mode or another, some

18
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.600
indicators that show the active

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.000
working mode, the cartesian

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.960
coordinates of the robot, the angle of the

21
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.879
auxiliary rotation axis (if the robot

22
00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.199
has one), the active coordinate system, and

23
00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.760
the cycles per minute of that robot. In the

24
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.640
left section, we will have what is

25
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.960
the button panel to navigate through

26
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.960
all the 

27
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.239
panels included in the application.

28
00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.960
The default panel is "Configuration," where

29
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.479
we can assign values to

30
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.400
a series of parameters that will

31
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.080
allow us to configure the general

32
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.439
behavior of the application. Through the

33
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.040
"Automatic" button, we will enter the panel

34
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.360
where information related to the automatic

35
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.119
working mode will be shown,

36
00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.920
just like with 

37
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.840
the "Learning" and

38
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920
"Impulses" buttons. With the "Recipes" button,

39
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.079
we will access a specific panel

40
00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.200
to manage what are

41
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
the recipes (loading, editing, deleting

42
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.280
recipes) and also to configure all

43
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.119
the application parameters to their

44
00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.280
default value. In the "Alarms" panel,

45
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.360
we will have a view of the 10 active

46
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.000
alarms at this moment and a summary of the

47
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.159
status of each of the robots

48
00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.640
used. Finally, we have access to

49
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.000
a series of specific panels that

50
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.200
are in the template used to

51
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.039
build the Multirobot application 

52
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.240
development platform.

53
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.399
These visualization panels have been

54
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.080
kept as they are because they might be

55
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.480
interesting if the application 

56
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.400
is expanded. To return to the

57
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.040
visualization panels, we go to "Vis_Navigation"

58
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.239
and click on "Go Application".

59
00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.120
Finally, we can choose the language of the

60
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.400
visualization panels 

61
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.040
through a series of flags: this

62
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.800
would be in Spanish, English, and also

63
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.440
in Portuguese.

64
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560
The central panel

65
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.920
changes according to the

66
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.319
button pressed at any

67
00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.959
moment. And finally, we have a

68
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.319
right section that will show the

69
00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.879
information of the hardware elements

70
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.000
of the controller, that is, digital inputs and

71
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.480
outputs, or emergency 

72
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.200
inputs. In the specific case of

73
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.319
viewing the "Automatic"

74
00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.280
panel, we will see, in addition, the content

75
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.040
of the displacement logs

76
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.760
for the pick and

77
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.080
place belts. And that's all.
