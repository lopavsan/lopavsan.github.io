00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.160
In this video, the

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.839
composition of the

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.160
visualization screens used by the

4
00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.679
application will be described. To access them, we will

5
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
double-click on "Vis_Principal" or, if we are not

6
00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.400
using the development environment, we will use a web browser

7
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.400
and the address http, IP of the controller,

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.320
port 8080 and the page name

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.840
"webvisu.htm". Well, a visualization screen is composed of four

10
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.160
sectors: a top sector where

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.760
you can choose the robot you want

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
to interact with. Then, there is also a

13
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.760
set of buttons to request entry into

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.840
one working mode or another, some

15
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.840
indicators that show the active working mode, the

16
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.360
Cartesian coordinates of the robot, the angle of the

17
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.000
auxiliary rotation axis (if the robot has one),

18
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.960
the active coordinate system, and

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.879
the cycles per minute of that robot. In the

20
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.199
left section, we will have what is

21
00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.760
the button panel to navigate through

22
00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.960
all the panels included in the application.

23
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.879
The default panel is "Configuration," where

24
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.960
we can assign values to

25
00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.239
a series of parameters that will

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.479
allow us to configure the general

27
00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.400
behavior of the application. Through the

28
00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.080
"Automatic" button, we will enter the panel

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.439
where information related to the automatic

30
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.040
working mode will be shown,

31
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.360
just like with the "Learning" and

32
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.920
"Impulses" buttons. With the "Recipes" button,

33
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.840
we will access a specific panel

34
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.079
to manage what are

35
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:36.000
the recipes (loading, editing, deleting

36
00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:41.119
recipes) and also to configure all

37
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.280
the application parameters to their

38
00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.360
default value. In the "Alarms" panel,

39
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.000
we will have a view of the 10 active alarms

40
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.159
at this moment and a summary of the

41
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.640
status of each of the robots

42
00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.000
used. Finally, we have access to

43
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.200
a series of specific panels that

44
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.039
are in the template used to

45
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.240
build the Multirobot application development platform.

46
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:08.399
These visualization panels have been

47
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.080
kept as they are because they might be

48
00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.480
interesting if the application is expanded.

49
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.400
To return to the

50
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.040
visualization panels, we go to "Vis_Navigation"

51
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.239
and click on "Go to Application".

52
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.120
Finally, we can choose the language of the

53
00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.400
visualization panels through a series

54
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.040
of flags: this would be in Spanish, English, and also

55
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.800
in Portuguese.

56
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.440
The central panel

57
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.560
changes according to the

58
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.920
button pressed at any

59
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.319
moment. And finally, we have a

60
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.959
right section that will show the

61
00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.879
information of the hardware elements

62
00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.000
of the controller, that is, digital inputs and

63
00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.480
outputs, or emergency inputs. In the specific case of

64
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.200
viewing the "Automatic" panel, we will see, in addition, the content

65
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.319
of the displacement logs

66
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.280
for the pick and place belts. And that's all.
