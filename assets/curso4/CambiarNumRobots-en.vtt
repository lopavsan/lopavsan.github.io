00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.800
In this video, we will see how to modify the

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.120
total number of robots that our

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.799
application will control. The starting

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.719
point, as we can see, would be a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.000
situation where we have four

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.440
robots and want to reduce them to two robots.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.840
Before making the change, it must be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.240
noted that the code associated with each

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.960
robot, even if they are deactivated,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.039
is still running and consuming a

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.560
certain amount of resources. If we look, for

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.320
example, at the code associated with robot

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.560
number 3,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.960
we see that it is indeed

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.640
being executed; there is a certain amount of code and some

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.120
resources that are involved

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.800
in the process.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.039
So, since our objective

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.920
is to remove robots number 3 and 4,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.719
we simply go offline, we

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.840
go to the "Robotics" folder, to the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.239
"Control Robots" subfolder, and to the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.280
"Global Variables List" object

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.840
corresponding to the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.520
robots, we access the global constant

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.239
"Maximum Number of Robots" and simply

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.559
change this four to a

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.360
two, then we download.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.080
While the download is in progress, since

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.600
it might take a bit, it should be mentioned that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.920
it might seem more logical for these

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.360
parameters to be in the configuration

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.439
panel, since what we are

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.600
doing is configuring the application. However,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.040
it was ultimately decided

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.200
to place them inside the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.640
code as global constants, because

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.000
they critically affect

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.520
hardware elements of the application, which

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.600
we already know during the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.320
machine qualification process. Therefore, they will

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.159
not change during the

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.159
development phase of the

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.119
application. Okay, it seems like it's

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.360
uploading... we got it. We press "Play",

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.079
go back to the automatic mode panel of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560
operation and we see that indeed,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.399
our application, which initially

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.399
had four robots, now only shows two.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.960
Moreover, if we try to access robot number three,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.039
we see that it no longer lets us (we only have

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.679
two). And if we check the code associated

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.360
with robot number three, which we have

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360
removed, we see that indeed this

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.480
code is no longer running, so

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.959
there is no resource consumption. What we

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.080
have done is simply remove

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.560
robots three and four from control,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.160
but we haven't modified the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.440
code of the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.760
Multirobot development platform at all.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.280
The code still exists, it just doesn't run, so it doesn't consume

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.440
resources.
